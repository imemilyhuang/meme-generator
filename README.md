# Meme Generator
I created this meme generator while following along with section 3 of the free React course on Scrimba. Previously, the projects I created were all static sites, but the user can actually interact with this one.

Through this project, I learned to utilize event listeners, forms, useState(), and useEffect(). Plus, I fetched data from an API for the first time! The API contains data on the current 100 most-popular memes. You can test out the meme generator by following the Vercel link.

Note: for some of the memes from the API, the "caption" isn't meant to be placed at the top and bottom of the image, and this meme generator doesn't account for that.
